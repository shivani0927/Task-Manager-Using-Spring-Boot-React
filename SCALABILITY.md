To prepare this application for high traffic, my strategy focuses on three areas:

- Splitting the Code: I would divide the application into two separate, smaller services: one just for Signing In/Auth, and one for Managing Tasks. We would put an API Gateway in front to manage all traffic. This separation helps us fix and update one part without crashing the other.


- Faster Performance: I would add Redis Caching to save certain information in quick memory. This is mainly used to quickly check if a user's JWT token is valid and to store simple user details. This means we don't have to bother the main database for these checks, making the app much faster.


- Handling More Data: Since the Tasks list will grow quickly, I would use a technique called Database Sharding. This means instead of keeping all the task data on one database server, we split the data across several servers. This helps the database manage both reading and writing tasks much faster as the project scales.
